# USB-Forensics-Project

**Project Summary:**
This USB Forensic project involved analyzing a USB thumb drive recovered in an intellectual property theft investigation by the FBI. Using tools like FTK Imager, DeepSound, SQLite Studio, and HexEditor, the investigation uncovered hidden files, encrypted documents, and password-protected archives. Evidence included stolen home floor plans and clues indicating the suspect's meeting location, contact person, item to be ordered, and software used for duplicating plans. This data was crucial for advancing the case against the suspect.

**Learning Points:**
1. **Forensic Analysis Tools**: Gained practical experience with FTK Imager, DeepSound, SQLite Studio, and HexEditor for extracting and analyzing data from digital storage.
2. **Data Decryption Techniques**: Used decryption strategies and custom dictionaries to bypass password-protected files, revealing critical evidence.
3. **Steganography in Forensics**: Encountered and decoded hidden data within files, underscoring the importance of checking for concealed information.
4. **Documenting Evidence**: Learned the process of organizing and documenting findings systematically for legal proceedings.
5. **File Format Identification**: Applied hex analysis to identify file formats, crucial for handling misidentified or altered files in forensic investigations.
6. **Critical Thinking in Investigations**: Developed logical problem-solving skills by following leads and extracting actionable information from obscure data points. 

This project highlights essential skills and techniques in digital forensics, emphasizing precision and thoroughness in handling evidence.
